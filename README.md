- build a backend API that serves as the bridge between the frontend and PostgreSQL database using Node.js typescript
- install the PostgreSQL client library Configure connection string with the database credentials 
- Set up connection pooling for better performance Define routes for CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Implement data validation and error handling 
- Deploy the backend on localhost 
- Replace mock data with API calls using axios 
- Handle loading states and errors 
- Update state management to work with real data

- herre is a Quick Start Example (Node.js)
javascript// Basic Express server structure
const express = require('express');
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL
});

app.get('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  const result = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM users');
  res.json(result.rows);
});

match the forms fields with the datatable schemma by creating fields in database datatable

# STA-CRM 6.0

Customer Relationship Management system with full-featured backend API and modern React frontend.

## Database Schema Updates

The application has been updated to match form fields with database schema. The following changes have been made:

### Client Table Updates
- Added `gender` field (VARCHAR(10))
- Added `first_name` and `last_name` fields (VARCHAR(100))
- Added `birth_date` field (DATE)
- Added `ccp_account` field (VARCHAR(50))
- Added `cle` field (VARCHAR(10))
- Added `rip` field (VARCHAR(100))
- Added `rip_cle` field (VARCHAR(10))
- Added `revenue` field (DECIMAL(12,2))

### Product Table Updates
- Added `reference` field (VARCHAR(100))
- Added `sell_price` field (DECIMAL(10,2))
- Added `buy_price` field (DECIMAL(10,2))
- Existing `price` field is now kept in sync with `sell_price`

### Professional Domain Table Updates
- Added `payment_code` field (VARCHAR(50))

## Running Migrations

To apply these database changes, run the following command:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:all
```

This will run all migration files in the `server/src/db/migrations` directory in order.

## API Endpoints

The API endpoints have been updated to handle the new fields:

### Client Endpoints
- `POST /api/clients` - Create a new client with all fields
- `PUT /api/clients/:id` - Update a client with all fields

### Product Endpoints
- `POST /api/products` - Create a new product with all fields
- `PUT /api/products/:id` - Update a product with all fields

### Professional Domain Endpoints
- `POST /api/professional-domains` - Create a new professional domain with payment_code
- `PUT /api/professional-domains/:id` - Update a professional domain with payment_code

## Frontend Integration

The frontend has been updated to handle the new fields in the forms and display them in the UI. The mapping between frontend field names and database field names is handled in the CRM context.




please fix the console error in the screenshot
just fix the server errors without changing the front end
and check all the codebase check if there are any other similar issues with other features that need to be fixed

fix the database error without changing the frontend
dont change anything to thr front end just change the database datatable or context or server api controller database schema


Scan the frontend design and analyze the displayed data structure, including all forms, fields, and components. Based on this analysis, generate a PostgreSQL database schema that matches the data requirements for the frontend. Ensure the following:
	1.	Identify all tables, columns, and their data types based on the UI components and expected data.
	2.	Create primary keys for each table and establish relationships between tables using foreign keys where necessary.
	3.	Optimize the schema for efficient queries, considering indexing for frequently accessed fields.
	4.	Include constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and default values where applicable.

- ok add deleted succesfully toast for everything that can be deleted








For example, if you want to modify a file and commit the changes, you would:

Stage the changes with git add . (or specific files)
Commit with git commit -m "Your commit message"

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- PostgreSQL (v12+)
- npm or yarn

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sta-crm.git
cd sta-crm
```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Install backend dependencies**

```bash
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

4. **Set up environment variables**

```bash
# Create frontend .env file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Create backend .env file
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

Edit both `.env` files with your configuration.

5. **Set up the database**

```bash
# Create PostgreSQL database
createdb stacrmdb

# Run database migrations
cd server
npm run setup-db
cd ..
```

6. **Start the development servers**

```bash
# In one terminal, start the backend
cd server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, start the frontend
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Environment Variables

### Frontend (.env.local)

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### Backend (server/.env)

See [server/.env.example](server/.env.example) for all available options.

## API Documentation

The API endpoints are organized by resource:

- `/api/auth` - Authentication
- `/api/clients` - Client management
- `/api/providers` - Provider management
- `/api/products` - Product management
- `/api/categories` - Category management
- `/api/brands` - Brand management
- `/api/orders` - Order management
- `/api/invoices` - Invoice management
- `/api/client-logs` - Client activity logs
- `/api/order-logs` - Order activity logs

## Deployment

For detailed deployment instructions, see [STA-CRM-Deployment-Guide.md](STA-CRM-Deployment-Guide.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If you encounter database connection problems:

1. Verify your database credentials in `server/.env`
2. Check if PostgreSQL is running: `sudo service postgresql status`
3. Ensure the database exists: `psql -l | grep stacrmdb`
4. Check server logs for specific error messages: `cd server && npm run logs`

### API Connection Errors

If the frontend can't connect to the API:

1. Verify the API server is running
2. Check CORS settings in `server/src/index.ts`
3. Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set correctly in frontend `.env.local`
4. Look for connection errors in browser console

## Common Issues

### "Request timed out" errors

This usually indicates the backend is having trouble connecting to the database. Check:

1. Database credentials in `server/.env`
2. PostgreSQL server status
3. Network connectivity between API server and database
4. Server logs for detailed error messages

### CORS errors

If you see CORS-related errors in the browser console:

1. Ensure the API server has CORS properly configured for your frontend domain
2. Check that the `CORS_ORIGIN` in `server/.env` matches your frontend URL
3. Verify that the Nginx configuration (if used) properly handles CORS headers

### Authentication issues

If login or registration fails:

1. Check if the JWT secret is properly set in `server/.env`
2. Verify user records exist in the database
3. Check for password hashing issues in server logs
4. Ensure the frontend is sending credentials in the correct format
